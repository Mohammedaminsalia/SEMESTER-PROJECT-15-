LIBRARY MANAGEMENT:
Library Management System provides an interface to register new users, check
in, report generations, manage library resources and handle book checkout.
Managing user accounts, creating reports, and monitoring library usage is extra
functionality provided by the library management system. The libraryâ€™s
management system can keep track of the books it has on hand, which include
their availability information such as location, as well as the individuals that are
borrowing them, their due dates, and any fines they may have gained. The
information in Library Management System is stored and retrieved by the object-
oriented system using a variety of technologies and techniques, which include
classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and data structures.
